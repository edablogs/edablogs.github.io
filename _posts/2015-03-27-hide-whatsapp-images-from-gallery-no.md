Hello guys now days everyone is using _**whatsapp**_, and every day you download many _videos_ and _images_ from _**whatsapp**_, but images are _personal or adult_ which you don't want to show to others or children. Because if you have joined _whatsapp groups_ then you will receive hundreds of images daily. Its not easy task to delete images daily or lock particular images. So here is method to hide _**whatsapp images**_ or particular _images_ and _videos_ from your gallery.

If you use any locker to lock or hide _**whatsapp images**_ or other folder then **whatsapp** will not recognize that images and **[Whatsapp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp "WhatsApp")** will create new folder named _images_ and save new images. Now that is again a problem. So there is solution for this problem.So now no need to download apps to hide images that apps uses large amount of _[RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random-access memory")_ cause they are _running in background_ which may _slow down_ your android mobile. if you have low _RAM_ available on your mobile then its impossible to use any locker. so try this method and enjoy.

### How to hide images?

*   First of all open any _[file manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager "File manager")_ in your mobile. **Batter** is to use [ES file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&hl=en "Download es file manager").
*   Goto **options** and select _**show hidden [files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file")**_ option, click on it and this will show on.

*   Now open **whatsapp** folder and goto this path _**Media > WhatsappImages**_

_**[](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eAwCEXxaSDA/VUfIcrncb4I/AAAAAAAAAdI/UOgQ5xx2yR0/s1600/2.jpg)**_ 

*   Here you can see all _images_ which you have received on **whatsapp**.
*   Click on _**new**_ option and select _**file**_.

*   In file name enter "<span style="color: red;">_**.nomedia**_</span>"

*   Now close _es file manager_ and open gallery now _**whatsapp images**_ will not show in gallery.( *to show again just delete "<span style="color: red;">_**.nomedia**_</span>" file.)

*   In this way you can also hide other _images_ from gallery.

This procedure is _100%_ safe and working on all _version of android_. And this will take just 1-2 minutes and save _RAM_.
