Hello guys,

You all know that JIO had announced unlimited downloading without speed capping at night from 2A.M. to 5A.M. (Happy hours). Which is great offer to download big files. but problem is that you have to stay awake from 2A.M. to 5A.M. to download your files, which is too hard for we lazy persons ðŸ˜„ .

So you can enjoy this Happy hours without waking at night, yes you can enjoy this benefit while you are sleeping.

# <span class="post-orange">How to download files when you are sleeping ?</span>
You can use Advanced Download Manager (ADM) from playstore. benefit of ADM is it download files in multiple parts which gives maximum speed while downloading files (same as IDM 'Internet Download Manager' on windows.), and another benefit is you can schedule your download from specific till specific time.
