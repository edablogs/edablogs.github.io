## 10 best websites for Android app development

For _**[Android](http://code.google.com/android/ "Android") app development**_ we need basic knowledge about **[XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML")** and **core java**. We can start _**Android [application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") development**_ if we know about these languages. But if you just started _**Android application development**_ or you don't know [programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") then you can make simple apps online too. For online _**[Mobile application development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_application_development "Mobile application development")**_ we don't need any programming language. but its lacks some features like no source code and some other limitations i will discus in end of this post.

[![10-best-websites-for-android-app-development](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T3aaMNrX7kg/Vc8DRBev_TI/AAAAAAAAHcI/RxMRW66ALd4/s320/10-best-websites-for-android-app-development.gif "10-best-websites-for-android-app-development")](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T3aaMNrX7kg/Vc8DRBev_TI/AAAAAAAAHcI/RxMRW66ALd4/s1600/10-best-websites-for-android-app-development.gif)

In any [Software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") / **_Mobile application development_** coding part is easy but most difficult part is "**Logic**". We need to implement our idea for _**Android application development**_. To make this part easy you can use online tools which help us to design android app by simple drag and drop. its only for starter who just want to develop android app for fun. for example if you want to develop android app for your website/blog, then this will help you.

But if you thinking to develop Android high graphics game using online tool then this is impossible, for high graphics games to need to learn [Open GL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL "OpenGL"). So you can only make simple apps mostly for your website / blogs.

## List of Android app [development tools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_tool "Programming tool") (websites) online :

*   [AppYet](http://www.appyet.com/)
*   [AppsBar](http://www.appsbar.com/)
*   [Appshed](http://appshed.com/)
*   [Appypie](http://www.appypie.com/android-app-builder)
*   [ibuildapp](http://ibuildapp.com/)
*   [buildfire](http://buildfire.com/)
*   [appmakr](https://www.appmakr.com/)
*   [appsgeyser](http://www.appsgeyser.com/)
*   [makemedroid](http://www.makemedroid.com/)
*   [androidcreator](http://www.androidcreator.com/)

## Limitations of Android app development using online tools :

1.  No source code (<span style="color: red;">means you will get only</span> .[apk file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APK_%28file_format%29 "APK (file format)"))
2.  No ads. (<span style="color: red;">You can't put your ads in these apps to earn money</span>)

If you want to become professional in _**Android application development**_ then go for Core java and start learning Android. For those you can use **Android IDE** like **Eclipse** or **Android studio**. But i suggest you to use **Eclipse** which is easier than **Android studio**. You can download from eclipse.org and you need to configure **ADT** (**Android Development Kit**) inside eclipse to start building apps in Eclipse. And you can download **ADT** from [Android Developer](http://developer.android.com/) wesite
