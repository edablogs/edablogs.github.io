## <span style="color: #ff6600;">Xposed framework Asus zenfone (only x86 devices).</span>

For lollipop devices there is unofficial version of xposed installer available which should be installed in two parts.

1.  Binary
2.  APK

Binary Should be installed through Custom recovery only. So you need to flash custom recovery on your mobile. To install custom recovery you need to unlock [bootloader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting "Booting").

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Useful links :</span>

Apk file should be install as normal app. APK will remain same if any update avaialble for Xposed framework, you need to just flash binary files each time when update available.
