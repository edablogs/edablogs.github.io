Hello zenfone 5 users there is a good news for you all that unofficial [Android](http://code.google.com/android/ "Android") 6.0 rom is successfully ported for our device. Maybe you all had tried **CM12.1** rom on our **Zenfone 5** rom then you will know how to install **[CM13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM_postcode_area "CM postcode area")** rom on **zenfone 5** rom. but if you haven't tried CM based or any other custom rom on **Zenfone 5** then i will teach you how to install this rom.

## Cm13 rom Review in Zenfone 5 :

*   **No Lags :** There is no lag in this cm13 rom, but if you are getting lags then its bootloader unlocking tool's problem. And you will face lags on all custom roms.
*   **[Battery Backup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply "Uninterruptible power supply")** : Battery backup is same as [CM12.1 rom by Dgadelha](http://edablogs.com/cm12/zenfone-5/cm-121-by-dgadelha-for-zenfone-5-review "CM12.1 rom by dgadelha reviews").
*   **No Screen autolock issue on 2G data** : this issue was there in RR rom.
*   **No Freeze after call **(if you faced reboot after call then disable [Double Tap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Tap_%28film%29 "Double Tap (film)") 2 Wake feature).
*   **No Reboot after call**. (if you faced reboot after call then disable Double Tap 2 Wake feature).
*   Stable and Best for daily use.
*   Better than other CM13 rom for zenfone 5.
*   Theme Chooser app working fine.
*   Latest Messaging App.
*   Latest Android 6.0 Animations effect.
*   No [UI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") lagging problem. (using this rom from last night and no UI lag problem.)
*   Awesome camera (not Asus PixelMaster, but you can install Asus Pixel Master camera and Asus Gallery).
*   **Pre Rooted** (No need to Root).
*   Xposed Framework works fine (Xposed framework is not pre installed, you need to install it)
*   **Android 6.0's Runtime Permission feature** (this is awesome feature launched by google in android's Marshmallows version, this in feature when you install any app then it will no ask you for permissions, Apps will install without permissions, and when you run that app and it will ask you to allow or deny for permission which are required by that app. which means now app installation is faster than before).

## Bugs with their solutions :

*   **[GPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System") not working** : GPS is also not working on any custom rom for zenfone 5, this is known and neglectable .

**solution** : Try using A-GPS/Mobile Location.

*   Video recording in 1080p ([full HD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p "1080p")) lags.

**solution** : Record video in HD mode (720p) mode.

*   FM Radio doesn't work : [FM radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting "FM broadcasting") also not working on any other custom roms.

**solution** : Try using [TuneIn](http://www.tunein.com "TuneIn") Radio, a lot of local radios are already there.
