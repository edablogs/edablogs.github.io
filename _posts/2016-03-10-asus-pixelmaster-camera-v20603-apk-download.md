# <span style="color: #ff6600;">Asus PixelMaster Camera v2.0.60.3</span>

Asus rolled out new update for **Asus PixelMaster** on 08 march 2016, but few users of Asus Zenfone mobiles got this new update. Dont know where is problem. I got this update on CM12.1 rom. so i have updated my **Asus PixelMaster** to latest version and uploading that apk file so every one can download and install on their asus zenfone.

*   In this update asus have added QR code scanner mode in _asus pixelmaster_, so now we dont need to download third party QR Scanner app to scan QR codes.
*   And in this latest version on _Asus PixelMaster_ if you place any camera mode to first place then that will be default mode if you open _asus pixelmaster_ next time. for example if you place HDR mode at first place and when you open **Asus pixelMaster** next time then it will open in HDR mode.
*   And they have also improved Image viewing Speed. after capturing images from latest **Asus pixelMaster.**
*   And you can browse recently taken photos from lock screen if you activated secure lock like pattern lock or password etc lock. But this feature will decrease security but maybe this is good feature for some users who like to see their new images without unlocking device. So they can show their new images to their friends without unlocking their mobile. (_means your friends can't access your private data and other stuff_).
