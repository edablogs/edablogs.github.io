## Zenfone 5 Kitkat/Lollipop Fastboot.img flashable

This post is for those who are unable to start [fastboot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_software_development "Android software development"), but they can start custom recovery like **_TWRP_**.I have seen many users are facing this issue that they are unable to start fastboot , but they can still boot into **_TWRP recovery_**. The reason behind this is that **fastboot** not instaled in there mobile successfully when they are **installing TWRP**, or **_fastboot_** is corrupted due to **TWRP recovery**.

[![Zenfone 5 Kitkat/Lollipop Fastboot.img flashable](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E5guSRknYyw/VbNPiZeqFFI/AAAAAAAAHN0/djhzuisgNu4/s1600/zenfone-5-kitkat-lollipop-fastboot-img-flashable.png "Zenfone 5 Kitkat/Lollipop Fastboot.img flashable")](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E5guSRknYyw/VbNPiZeqFFI/AAAAAAAAHN0/djhzuisgNu4/s1600/zenfone-5-kitkat-lollipop-fastboot-img-flashable.png)

So i have mode flashable file which will **flash fastboot.img** in there mobile. We can't flash **fastboot.img** from [PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer") at this time, because to flash any img file from PC, you need to connect your mobile in fastboot mode.

So if you can use **TWRP recovery** then you can easily install fastboot in your mobile using my this patch. But if you can't use **TWRP** or any other custom recovery then you can't install **fastboot**. But if you can start your mobile normally then maybe you can try some apps from playstore which can flash fastboot.img . But if there is no such app which can flash **fastboot.img** in **Asus Zenfone** then i ll make such app which can flash **fastboot.img**, **recovery.img**, **boot.img**.

### How to flash fastboot from [TWRP](http://www.xdablogs.com/2015/06/twrp-recovery-for-zenfone-5-stable.html) or pHilz recovery :

1.  Download fastboot.img flashable zip from below link. (<span style="color: red;">* choose which fastboot you want kitkat or lollipop</span>).

[Fastboot for Kitkat](https://userscloud.com/27n0d5ygr0qv)

[Fastboot for Lollipop](https://userscloud.com/rtg9xfd22gfk)

1.  Now put that downloaded file in your **Internal memory** or **external memory**.
2.  Now restart your mobile into TWRP or pHilz recovery.
3.  In TWRP recovery choose "**_Install_**" option and locate that file which you have placed in internal or external memory.
4.  Now move the slider to Right and wait till [Installation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_%28computer_programs%29 "Installation (computer programs)") complete.
5.  When installation complete successfully your mobile will restart automatically.
