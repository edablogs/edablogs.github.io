## Zenfone 5 Kitkat/Lollipop Fastboot.img flashable

This post is for those who are unable to start [fastboot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_software_development "Android software development"), but they can start custom recovery like **_TWRP_**.I have seen many users are facing this issue that they are unable to start fastboot , but they can still boot into **_TWRP recovery_**. The reason behind this is that **fastboot** not instaled in there mobile successfully when they are **installing TWRP**, or **_fastboot_** is corrupted due to **TWRP recovery**.

[![Zenfone 5 Kitkat/Lollipop Fastboot.img flashable](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E5guSRknYyw/VbNPiZeqFFI/AAAAAAAAHN0/djhzuisgNu4/s1600/zenfone-5-kitkat-lollipop-fastboot-img-flashable.png "Zenfone 5 Kitkat/Lollipop Fastboot.img flashable")](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E5guSRknYyw/VbNPiZeqFFI/AAAAAAAAHN0/djhzuisgNu4/s1600/zenfone-5-kitkat-lollipop-fastboot-img-flashable.png)

So i have mode flashable file which will **flash fastboot.img** in there mobile. We can't flash **fastboot.img** from [PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer") at this time, because to flash any img file from PC, you need to connect your mobile in fastboot mode.

So if you can use **TWRP recovery** then you can easily install fastboot in your mobile using my this patch. But if you can't use **TWRP** or any other custom recovery then you can't install **fastboot**. But if you can start your mobile normally then maybe you can try some apps from playstore which can flash fastboot.img . But if there is no such app which can flash **fastboot.img** in **Asus Zenfone** then i ll make such app which can flash **fastboot.img**, **recovery.img**, **boot.img**.

### How to flash fastboot from [TWRP](http://www.xdablogs.com/2015/06/twrp-recovery-for-zenfone-5-stable.html) or pHilz recovery :

1.  Download fastboot.img flashable zip from below link. (<span style="color: red;">* choose which fastboot you want kitkat or lollipop</span>).

[Fastboot for Kitkat](https://userscloud.com/27n0d5ygr0qv)

[Fastboot for Lollipop](https://userscloud.com/rtg9xfd22gfk)

1.  Now put that downloaded file in your **Internal memory** or **external memory**.
2.  Now restart your mobile into TWRP or pHilz recovery.
3.  In TWRP recovery choose "**_Install_**" option and locate that file which you have placed in internal or external memory.
4.  Now move the slider to Right and wait till [Installation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_%28computer_programs%29 "Installation (computer programs)") complete.
5.  When installation complete successfully your mobile will restart automatically.

Now you can start your mobile into fastboot. If you are facing this problem after flashing this patch then comment below i will help you further. If you are **facing any issue while flashing** this patch then send me screenshot or Image of that problem. I will solve your problem.
