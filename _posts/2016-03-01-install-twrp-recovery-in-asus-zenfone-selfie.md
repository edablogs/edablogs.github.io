## <span style="color: #ff6600;">TWRP recovery for asus Zenfone Selfie :</span>

### <span style="color: #ff6600;">why we need TWRP recovery?</span>

**TWRP recovery** help us to flash custom [files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file"), Roms. custom recovery shouldn't flashed with stock recovery (original recovery). Because stock recovery doesn't verify signature of custom flashable files or custom Rom. so we will use custom recovery like TWRP. it bypass signature verification and allow us to flash custom rom and other stuff. **TWRP recovery** also help us to root our device. You can flash Super SU binaries to root your device.
