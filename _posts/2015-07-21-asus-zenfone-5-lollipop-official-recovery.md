## Asus Zenfone 5 Lollipop official recovery.img

Hello Zenfone 5 owners, So now you all are enjoying Lollipop on your mobile. But in Lollipop ROM there is no Recovery.img. Recovery is embed inside system partition for security purpose. But if you want to root or by any other reason you changed recovery to Kitkat recovery or Custom recovery like [TWRP recovery](http://www.xdablogs.com/2015/06/twrp-recovery-for-zenfone-5-stable.html) or [Philz recovery](http://www.xdablogs.com/2015/02/latest-philz-recovery-for-asus-zenfone-5.html) then you cant revert back to Lollipop recovery.img which means to can't get [OTA update](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming "Over-the-air programming").

[![Asus Zenfone 5 Lollipop official recovery.img](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFK2gc7G9DI/Va5BmnLwH-I/AAAAAAAAHMU/_fxcpjcgGME/s1600/Asus-Zenfone-5-Lollipop-official-recovery-img.png "Asus Zenfone 5 Lollipop official recovery.img")](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFK2gc7G9DI/Va5BmnLwH-I/AAAAAAAAHMU/_fxcpjcgGME/s1600/Asus-Zenfone-5-Lollipop-official-recovery-img.png)

Because for _OTA update_ you need latest recovery installed because _OTA update_ patch first check for current installed ROM, if you have installed wrong recovery then _OTA update_ gives failure message. So at that time you have only single option to _install Lollipop ROM_ again then you will surely got _official OTA update_.

Recently [ASUS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus "Asus") has released _latest Lollipop ROM_ which is _WW_3_23_40_60_ . But you cant install this update directly from Kitkat you need to first install Lollipop _WW_3_23_40_52_ version then you can proceed to update. But if you are on Kitkat then you need to Download 2 lollipop roms which is 820 MB +820 Mb = approx 1.7GB. To avoid this problem here is solution. you can flash _WW_3_23_40_60 recovery.img_ only on Kitkat or Jellybean ROM. if you are on Lollipop _WW_3_23_40_52_ but you have flashed TWRP recovery then you can also flash this recovery.img to get _WW_3_23_40_52 official recovery_ to proceed to update to latest _lollipop WW_3_23_40_60_.
