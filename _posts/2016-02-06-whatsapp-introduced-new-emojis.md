These new emojies are available on whatsapp web from few months. But they are only visible on whatsapp web. In whatsapp only sqaure boxes are visible. So update whatsapp and enjoy more emojies. Means more fun.

But if your friends doesn't updated their whatsapp then they will not able to watch new emojies sent by you. So also tell your friends to update their whatsapp to latest version so they can also enjoy new cool emojies.

Whatsapp is becoming better day by day. few days ago whatsapp made it free for lifetime. And few days ago whatsapp increased [Whatsapp group member limit from 100 to 256.](http://www.edablogs.com/2016/02/now-256-members-are-allowed-in-whatsapp-group.html "Now 256 members are allowed in whatsapp group") And now they add some more new Emojies. which are cool.

So try and tell us whats more new in latest whatsapp. And last thing remaining in whatsapp, that is theme option. If whatsapp introduce theme option in whatsapp then whatsapp becode more coolest then ever. Maybe in latest update they will add theme option too.

So just wait. and for now update your whatsapp to get more emojies.
